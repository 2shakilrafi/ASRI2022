# ASRI2022

In the summer of 2022 I attended a workshop/summer school called Arkansas Summer Research Institute. This is an NSF EPSCOR funded workshop aiming to bring students from 
over two dozen states to work together and collaborate on a real-life machine learning application, and network with industry leaders, working scientists and researchers
to get a close-up view of the whole data science and machine learning process.
